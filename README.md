Using a Figma design, it is necessary to develop an app with a single screen that should include 4 elements:
	•	The last unprocessed photo from the user’s gallery.
	•	Two buttons: “Delete” and “Save.”
	•	A button to “Clear Cart.”

The screen should display photos from the user’s gallery one at a time, sorted by date (new photos should appear first).

The “Delete” button should add the current photo to the “cart” and display the next photo, while the “Save” button should only display the next photo without adding it to the cart.

When the “Clear Cart” button is pressed, all photos in the cart should be removed from the user’s gallery using native iOS methods.

Optional:
	•	Implement app restart handling at your discretion.

Additional Requirements:
	•	Use Swift and UIKit.
	•	Use Git.
	•	You can use any project architecture.
	•	Do not use third-party frameworks, except for SnapKit and RxSwift (you can also use Combine).
	•	Do not use xib or storyboard.
	•	Deployment target should be iOS 16.0.
